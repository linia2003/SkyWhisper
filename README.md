# Skywhisper

> **Status:** Prototype üöß ‚Äî Actively evolving. We‚Äôre iterating on data coverage, model accuracy, and UX. Expect changes and breaking updates.


**NASA-powered long-term weather insights with real-life preparedness tips ‚Äî built on open Earth data, AI, and human-centered design.**  
Skywhisper turns decades of NASA datasets into **actionable probabilities** (e.g., ‚Äú70% chance of >35¬∞C‚Äù) plus simple guidance (hydrate, umbrella, sunscreen, avoid low-lying areas). Designed with **Figma AI** for faster UI/code handoff and illustrated via **Gamma AI** for lightweight visuals.

## ‚ú® What it does
- **Probabilities of extremes** by location, timeframe, and variable (heat, heavy rain, wind, humidity, cloud cover).
- **Plain-language tips** to help people prepare in daily life.
- **Interactive dashboards** with graphs, maps, and summaries.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Data sources
- **NASA POWER** ‚Äì temperature & rainfall  
- **MERRA-2** ‚Äì humidity & wind  
- **MODIS** ‚Äì cloud cover  
- **GPM** ‚Äì precipitation & extremes

---

## üß† How it works
1. Users select **location**, **timeframe**, and **variable**.  
2. Historical archives are fetched from NASA APIs and bulk files.  
3. Python pipelines apply **Fourier Transform** to detect seasonal cycles and compute **long-term probabilities** of extremes.  
4. Results render in dashboards with clear summaries and practical advice.

**Example outputs**
- *‚Äú65% chance of >35¬∞C in April.‚Äù*  
- *‚Äú80% likelihood of heavy rain in July ‚Äî carry an umbrella; secure belongings; avoid low-lying areas.‚Äù*

## üé® Design & Assets (Figma AI + Gamma AI)
- **Figma AI **: UI ideation, auto-layout refinements, and code-ready specs (design tokens, component variants, layout guidance) to streamline frontend handoff.  
  Prototype: https://www.figma.com/make/M7HhzhhuwtKWbSf4x5g25Q/Weather-Dashboard-Prototype?node-id=0-4&t=8b0fFihGjG30bISK-1
- **Main Plan (canonical)**: The authoritative plan, UX flows, and requirements live in **Google Drive** ‚Üí  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17gY5buTk7rH2Qgmaeid5F-SfQCC5Zc9O 
- **Gamma AI**: Lightweight **illustrations, icons, and hero images** for dashboards and docs that communicate risk levels clearly.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
*Prototype priorities ‚Äî exactly as planned.*

- Health alerts (heat index, air-quality hooks)
  
- Disaster readiness modules (flood/wind advisories)
  
- Crop-planning tools & calendars
  
- Multilingual support
  
- Data export for researchers & policymakers

## üî≠ Project status & next steps
Skywhisper+ is a **prototype**. We are focusing solely on the items in the roadmap:
1) Health alerts
   
2) Disaster readiness modules
 
3) Crop-planning tools & calendars
   
4) Multilingual support
   
5) Data export for researchers & policymakers
